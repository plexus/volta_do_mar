Compiling this required a custom build of Clojure, and I seem to have lost the
changes I had made, but I think it's this block in Reflector.java that is
causing issues.


static {
	MethodHandle pred = null;
	try {
		if (! isJava8())
			pred = MethodHandles.lookup().findVirtual(Method.class, "canAccess", MethodType.methodType(boolean.class, Object.class));
	} catch (Throwable t) {
		Util.sneakyThrow(t);
	}
	CAN_ACCESS_PRED = pred;
}
